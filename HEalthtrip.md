HEalthtrip
Contributed to the design, development, and deployment of a large-scale SaaS healthcare platform serving 10,000+ daily active users across multiple countries. Focused on backend scalability, cloud infrastructure, and DevOps automation to enhance performance, reliability, and maintainability.

Migrated 50% of a legacy PHP monolith into modular NestJS microservices, improving scalability and deployment reliability by ~75%.
Designed and implemented RESTful and GraphQL APIs, improving API throughput by 40% and supporting third-party integrations.
Architected API gateway (Kong) for controlled partner access and JWT-based authentication, ensuring secure, rate-limited API consumption.
Applied system design and API architecture best practices to build scalable, fault-tolerant services with redundancy and load balancing.
Integrated Kafka-based message queues for asynchronous event handling and inter-service communication.
Performed database optimization (SQL indexing, query tuning), reducing query latency by 70% and supporting 2x concurrent user load.
Implemented caching strategies (Redis in-memory and distributed cache), reducing data retrieval times by 90%.

Designed and deployed a full CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins and GitHub Actions, automating build, test, and deployment workflows.
Reduced deployment time from 3 hours → 10 minutes and improved release frequency from monthly → daily.
Containerized all backend services using Docker Compose and deployed them on a Kubernetes cluster for scalability and fault tolerance.
Implemented Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principles for automated provisioning of AWS resources.
Configured load balancing, auto-scaling, and service discovery within Kubernetes, maintaining 99.9% uptime during peak load.
Established logging, monitoring, and observability pipelines with CloudWatch and Prometheus/Grafana dashboards.
Managed incident response and fault recovery, defining SLOs/SLIs and automated alert systems for early failure detection.

Managed and optimized 20+ AWS EC2 instances, S3 buckets, and CloudFront distributions integrated with Cloudflare CDN and WAF.
Deployed rate limiting, SSL/TLS encryption, and DDoS prevention mechanisms for secure content delivery.
Applied OWASP best practices, secure coding standards, and data encryption at rest and in transit.
Implemented secrets management using AWS KMS and environment variables for secure credential handling.
Reduced global page load times by 50% and improved uptime by 30% through optimized caching and CDN rules.

Built an internal translation management dashboard using Next.js and REST APIs, handling 1,000+ daily translation entries.
Reduced manual editing time by 50%, improved data consistency, and optimized UI load performance by 35%.
Used React Hooks, Context API, and responsive design principles for cross-browser compatibility and accessibility.

Participated in Agile development sprints, Scrum ceremonies, and code reviews, collaborating in a cross-functional team of 6 engineers.
Led stakeholder communication as the main developer on key backend services despite being an intern.
Created detailed technical documentation, API specs, and system design diagrams for internal teams and onboarding.
Contributed to knowledge sharing and mentorship, helping new developers onboard faster and align with system architecture.
