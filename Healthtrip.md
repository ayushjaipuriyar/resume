# **Healthtrip – Software Developer Intern**

Contributed to the design, development, and deployment of a large-scale SaaS healthcare platform serving 10,000+ daily users across multiple countries. Focused on backend scalability, cloud infrastructure, DevOps automation, and system reliability.

### **Backend Engineering**

* Migrated 50% of a legacy PHP monolith into modular NestJS microservices, improving scalability and deployment reliability by ~75%.
* Designed REST and GraphQL APIs for core healthcare services and third-party integrations, increasing API throughput by 40%.
* Implemented an API Gateway (Kong) with JWT-based auth for secure, rate-limited partner access.
* Integrated Kafka message queues for async workflows and inter-service communication.
* Optimised databases with indexing and query tuning, reducing query latency by 70% and supporting 2x more concurrent load.
* Added Redis caching (in-memory + distributed), improving data retrieval times by 90%.

### **Cloud & Infrastructure**

* Managed and optimised 20+ AWS EC2 instances, S3 buckets, CloudFront distributions, and Cloudflare CDN/WAF.
* Applied Infrastructure as Code practices for automated provisioning of AWS resources.
* Configured load balancing, auto-scaling, and service discovery within Kubernetes, maintaining 99.9% uptime during peak traffic.
* Implemented SSL/TLS, IAM best practices, rate limiting, DDoS protection, and encryption in transit/at rest.
* Reduced global page load times by 50% through CDN tuning and advanced caching rules.

### **DevOps & CI/CD**

* Built CI/CD pipelines with Jenkins and GitHub Actions, reducing deployments from 3 hours to 10 minutes.
* Increased release frequency from monthly to daily through automated build, test, and delivery workflows.
* Containerised backend services with Docker and deployed them using Kubernetes for high availability.
* Added monitoring and observability with CloudWatch, Prometheus, and Grafana dashboards.
* Set up automated alerting, SLOs/SLIs, and incident response workflows.

### **Frontend & Tools**

* Built an internal translation management dashboard using Next.js and REST APIs, handling 1,000+ daily entries.
* Cut manual editing time by 50% and improved UI load performance by 35%.
* Used React Hooks, Context API, and responsive design for accessibility and cross-browser support.

### **Collaboration & Leadership**

* Worked in a cross-functional Agile team of 6 engineers, participating in sprints and code reviews.
* Acted as main developer on several backend systems despite intern role, managing stakeholder communication.
* Created detailed technical documentation, API specs, and architecture diagrams.
* Helped onboard new developers and contributed to team knowledge-sharing.
